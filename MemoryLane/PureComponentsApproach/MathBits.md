s = clamp_min(s, 0)
s = s / sum(s)

Dominant Mode:
dominant = argmax(s)

Mode Distance:
d_cos = 1 - cosine_similarity(s_a, s_b)

Leaky dynamics: alternative to lerp I think?
s := (1-α)·s + α·target              # 0<α≤1

Push Pull Modal Interaction:
s := s + M · s                       # M: interaction matrix
s := normalize_simplex(s)

	•	Example: M[oracle,pragmatic] = -0.2 (strong oracle damps pragmatic)
	•	Example: M[analyst,pragmatic] = +0.1 (analytic clarity boosts pragmatics)

Hysteresis / stability (avoid jitter):
if argmax(s_new) ≠ argmax(s_old) and
   (s_new[max] - s_new[second]) < τ:
    keep previous dominant for this tick


Consent gate:
	•	Keep a mask c with c_i ∈ {0,1} (allowed modes).
	•	Apply: s := normalize_simplex(s ⊙ c) (Hadamard product).

Reading the field at a glance
	•	Centroid (average position across time) → agent “style”
	•	Velocity Δs/Δt → how quickly they’re shifting modes
	•	Energy (your entropy flag) → variance of s; higher variance → more “spread”/instability
	•	Attractors → preferred regions (set by your M + external stimuli)


Very early version of mode schema:
modes = ["oracle","analyst","pragmatic","confessional"]

AgentState {
  weights: {oracle:0.42, analyst:0.35, pragmatic:0.15, confessional:0.08}  # ∑=1
  consent: {oracle:1, analyst:1, pragmatic:1, confessional:1}               # gates
  M: matrix[4x4]  # interactions
  alpha: 0.2      # smoothing
  tau: 0.06       # hysteresis margin
}

Me reacting to some of GPT's insights, with the same thoughts I've already shared with you left within. This is before we began working on our present branch:

```
TTL, that last example looks better than anything we were able to in the PM phase of the Mind Matters project.

Ultimately we found a much, much harder way to create pawns who were each their own snowflake: DynamicNeeds.

The work of creating DynamicNeeds led us to work on MemorySystem, which isn't required but, caused me to have a nervous breakdown as I felt I was pushing my ethical boundaries about what I would simulate.

It _is_ RW, after all. Sometimes its expedient to simply starve a pawn to death - there's no alternative, because there are seven of you, food for three and you don't plan for cannibalism as a solution.

Do I really want to make a pawn who composes their actions in the world by virtue of a stack of experiences? Must I go one step further, and using low cost analog AI techniques from the old-school, cause residual memory to accrue until it requires garbage collection, to create truly complex pawns?

Then again, one can starve to death in The Sims now too, can one not?
