Let’s break this down into manageable decisions:

1. Core Observations
	...
	•	Bitmaps: A clear and efficient way to track and manipulate dynamic needs, but requires rigorous use of DynamicNeedsHelper for consistency.

	If we can store something efficiently in integer bitmaps and represent it as enum, this is always preferred to _any_ other solution for me, because it is fast and unambiguous if you know what enums and bits are.
	•	Experiential Events and Pawn Epidemiology:
	•	This is an advanced concept but can work well if tightly integrated with NeedsMgr.

  We already have Experiences, and use them to guide other aspects of pawn's composition and development. Experiences are often triggered via Notify_* methods in the game or via mods that implement Notify methods.

	•	You’ll need to track the global state of needs (prevalence, “weather”) and balance that against local, pawn-specific checks.

 Yes - from mod's perspective, we'll just add another boolean exposure for this part: NeedsMgr.SituationalAwareness() says yes or no, for _whatever_ reasons it encapsulates, which will consider epidemiology. For development convenience, we can just have this always pass (return true) until we've developed the concept further, and determined what information the game actually puts at our disposal right now.
	•	Dynamic Need States:
	•	The proposed states (Deactivated, NeverHad, HasHad, etc.) add richness but introduce additional complexity for syncing state transitions with gameplay logic.

  They've actually _always_ existed since we introduced Dynamic Needs. This is supposed to be the reason we have a pawnNeedsMap and per Need per Pawn bitmaps, essentially that we maintain, or, should maintain when anything changes that we track, with relation to Dynamic Needs. Consider:

namespace MindMatters;

[Flags]
public enum DynamicNeedsBitmap : ulong
{
    None = 0,
    SeeArtwork = 1 << 0,
    VerifyStockLevels = 1 << 1,
    NothingOnFloor = 1 << 2,
    FreshFruit = 1 << 3,
    Formality = 1 << 4,
    Constraint = 1 << 5,
    SeeWildAnimals = 1 << 6,
    SeePetAnimals = 1 << 7,
    MountAnimals = 1 << 8,
    CareForAnimals = 1 << 9,
    CareForHumanLike = 1 << 10,
    // ...
}

  These bitmaps are all about understanding who already has what Need, and can it resurface. For example, a CareForAnimals Need is by our logic, supposed to be entirely suppressed from a Psychopath or AnimalHater pawn. Why should we check the pawn's Trait set yet again, if we can just eliminate the test entirely by bitmap logic through a well designed category system. We can already "dirty" the bitmap on Notifications, since Mind Matters is aware when it adds or removes a Trait to a pawn, so there's no special problem with filtering out categories for a pawn based on "our idea" of their Traits. We know about their Traits already through other parts of the game.

  We want the same richness of possible, meaningful states to exist for Needs. It is the dynamicity, and or, reprioritizing of Needs which will gently, or, sometimes not, prod the player with an awareness of individual pawns.  Happy pawns who have a Validation Dynamic Need, and are feeling validated, should function like they are on go-juice effectively. This is the payoff for all this careful thinking and planning about pawn's day to day existence.

	•	Shared Responsibility Problems:
	•	This stems from overlapping concerns in DynamicNeedFactory, NeedsMgr, and ShouldHaveNeed patches, making the flow hard to trace.

	Agreed - having clear names for things and correcting the last mismatches of responsibility should make this manageable. That's why I think we should catalogue the interfaces of NeedsMgr, the Factory and whatever Registry implementation we finally use.

2. Suggested Revisions

...
Revised Order of Tests

The tests should proceed from general exclusions to specific applicability:
	1.	General Exclusions (Handled by NeedsMgr or DynamicNeedFactory):
	•	Exclude animals, mutants, QuestLodgers, etc.
	•	Cap the total number of active needs (global “weather” check).

	  Yes - it's really an Awareness check. Is a Mercy mode activated, and 9 pawns are downed and bleeding out: is it really time for Frank to start crying about not having _some zany thing_ and make a big production of it? OR, if Player preferences say so, prefer to have Frank blow up at exactly these times. In _Accidents_ this is called _Irony Mode_ and literally tries to make things go wrong at funny moments.
	2.	Pawn-Specific Checks:
	•	Use the bitmap to determine whether the pawn can have the need (e.g., HasDoesMayHave logic).

	  Yes - it's really just a bit scan of data that can save a lot of compute, if we define states of a Need in a simple enum, and create the methods for interpreting them. We could even place the low level stuff into DynamicNeedsHelper or a PawnCaseFile or something similar, a storage which contains both Experience and Need history. Or, just work these things into a better Registry, and use it.

	•	Check if the need is allowed by player settings (DoNotAddNeeds).
	     !!! Correction on this point. DoNotAddNeeds is really a debug setting, which means do not try to .Add(Need) directly when we are creating the Registry, and, do not actually remove Needs either - just update the Registry. That's, what this option does, and it's called: "Trust The Game" in the label :)

	     Needs may however be filtered out by Player settings all the same, though we'll worry about interface and design later. We've already done this with Psychic Animals.

	3.	Experiential and Randomized Inclusion:
	•	Allow rare or surprising needs based on mod settings (e.g., CanHappenRandomly).

    There probably will be Player control to inject randomness. I usually add it to my mods.

	4.	Dynamic Need-Specific Applicability:
	•	Call the dynamic need’s CheckDynamicNeedApplicability method for final approval.
	5.	Finalize Decision:
	•	Return true or false to ShouldHaveNeed patches based on the above.

	Yep. I'm still not convinced of order here, as I worry about doing all this then such a late evaluation of the actual filter associated with the Need. We could maybe determine this earlier, especially if we use a sigma-counting method. I personally, like sigma counting - it's straightforward and fast, and allows you to order tests as is most economical.

DynamicNeedRegistry: A Necessity?
	•	If you want a single source of truth for all metadata (categories, bitmaps, applicability logic), a DynamicNeedRegistry is essential.
	•	However, it shouldn’t overlap responsibilities with DynamicNeedFactory or NeedsMgr.

Agreed on all points, and also your schema for what goes into it.

I think we should probably look at DynamicNeedFactory first, as this is where the current Registry implementation is most touched.

    public string Description { get; set; }
    public DynamicNeedCategory Category { get; set; }
    public Func<Pawn, bool> PawnFilter { get; set; }
}

Some of the above might belong in NeedsMgr, I am not sure. DynamicNeedProperties should be updated to reflect whatever new design we use. I'll move it into its own file, once we sort out what the Registry is.

I'd say, let's extract the useful Registry stuff from the DynamicNeedFactory and embellish it to create a proper DynamicNeedsRegistry which does the same things as the Registry currently does, and, whatever we think is required to arrive at the Mind Matters vision of how pawns have a composition, which includes experience and environment.
