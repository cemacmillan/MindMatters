This might fill out the Trait _Retainer_ which we absolutely must do, and give other paths for a pawn to become one besides Dutiful Trait we add. Further, with AOSMeditation we add Adoration, Dedication (to a non-human such as a cow or deer, typically), so, any AOSMeditation target is by definition a safe way to approach this Need without DLC conflicts.

	32.	Wind Exposure Need // Partial implementation, through VE, but also we should do because there is a sensor for WindSpeed no one uses. We implement Pluviophile as Trait, but can implement now as a Need since they'll be approximately the same code, or, could share a needClass without difficulty.

Expanded Needs List

	4.	Fabric Preference // Must implement 
    4.b Best Fabric To Wear // Concerns self-and-other. Anything less is for _mouse chasers_ or some other category which seems ridiculous, but doesn't refer to the actual impoverished. It might mean: Anything less is for the person who sits on two chairs. We implement "Silk", so 0.81 of time it is Silk (whatever material is called "silk") or Hyperweave, being equal with this fixation.  
Needs to wear specific fabrics (e.g., cotton, linen) and avoids synthetic materials. Wrong textures cause distraction or distress.

	17.	Outdoor Ritual // Partial implementation via game Outdoor Need, but, could extend concept
Needs 30 minutes outside, regardless of weather, to feel balanced. Prolonged indoor time creates irritability.
	18.	Horizon Searching // Must implement - gives an alternate name for Trait Wanderlust implemented in other mods which doesn't conflict. Also, sometimes it _is_ Horizon Searching, not Wanderlust which drives some people.
Compelled to find and gaze at open horizons daily, calming restlessness and wanderlust.
	19.	Stone Clarity // Absolutely // Must implement
	19.b Trinket Need // Like Token need, but Trinkets are jewelry or pocket-items (we'll invent pockets, btw) 
Needs to handle or hold a smooth stone to focus thoughts. Losing access causes fidgety behavior.

Adaptive or Psychological Needs

	21.	Constraint Comfort // Implemented! Could use love and concept development

	23.	Symmetry Demand // Must figure out how, and implement
Needs symmetry in objects or their surroundings. Asymmetry causes agitation or obsessive correction attempts.
	24.	Quiet Teamwork // Must implement, complements MM Traits
Prefers tasks where others work silently nearby. Dislikes working in isolation or excessive conversation.

Fictive or Unusual Needs
	25.	Gravity Check // Must implement, I experience this, needing to think "sunward, groundward, to find upward" or using known stars at night. I have dropped coins to feel reassured during periods of lightness feeling, which is the combination of gravity off + lightness of heart. Very disorienting and wonderful.
Frequently compelled to test gravity, such as dropping small objects to observe their fall. Unmet need causes restlessness.
	26.	Imaginary Dialogue // Must implement - useful clues in text output about experience of pawn
	27. 26.b Monologue // Must implement - warnings of future issues, recognition of player success indirectly

	28.	Temporal Displacement // Must implement
	28.b. Specific Displacement: Cowboy Western In Space Syndrome, a constellation of obsessions with generator parts which do not exist, joy at finding Spaceship parts or Memorabilia, must wear Cowboy hat and Ship-focused at all times. Wants to get off this planet to being an attourney again.
    28.c. Believes They Are Actually A Settler|Tribesperson - we can more sensitively still implement this as simply insisting on tight-lacing, vests, and InconvenientSkirt or Trousers if they be a Tribesperson as a Cluster of Needs, insistence on some variation of TribalWear or TribalWearB (my own Tribal Ensembles that are functionally identical to Tribal A in total weight, stats, etc.) if they be non-colonist Settler, Insisting on _Ship Clothes_ or _MidWorld Clothes_ or _UrbWorld Gear_ depending on their backstory, or of course a Uniform of any kind, according to Backstory. Thus, to expand on this we can implement people who want to "go native" by just giving them the need to feel... let's come up with a word for it. Both Galician and Basque contribute a little to "Corunan" one of the made up languages used for place names. For the other sense, we have people wanting to dress up like 19th Century Edwardians or modern day RenFair lovers who freely mix these styles in with their ideas about Renaissance Fashion.
Feels “stuck” in the wrong time. Requires activities themed to a specific era to feel at peace.
   28.d Species Dysphoria, distinct from "Xenotype" Dysphoria which exists in the game. This person intensly feels that rather than being a human, they are in fact a cat in a human body. We'll have to be careful here, because actual persons do have this feeling. Like the real life people, they'll feel comfortable having things that their related species would want present. Even if they won't eat it (because of Assignment), presence of a bowl of Kibble in their Room will fully satisfy the "I Am Actually A Cat" individual. They'll be encouraged by having more cats around, cat-things in more places. Improving this, would be if Cat is the animal only 60% of the time, the rest being Dog (kibble and bone trinket latter to invent), Fox (Must sleep in room called a Den, which we add, doesn't like outdoors in open at daytime... can test game Cover from Fire possibilities frequently and have CoverNeed and "research" like task Need),Horse (hay in room, sleep in Stable or Barn), Large Animal (like Horse, but must sleep in Animal pen), etc.

   Problem causer Needs of this nature we'll ensure, are 80% likely to be associated with at least one useful capacity, ability, or some exotic display feature (with no effects) they can do. It may be a dance-step or something.

   1/240 pawns, whoever they are, will have high exposure to acquiring this Need, thus it will be an uncommon but "known about Quirk" since they all share the same Animal, for this form of the Need, thus appreciate each other more: "+12 Another Ferret Like Me!"

Medical or Therapy-Inspired
	29.	Rehabilitation Cycle // Must implement
Needs structured time for physical rehabilitation exercises, skipping sessions leads to physical or mental deterioration.
	30.	Therapy Check-In // Must implement, need to expand therapy concept
Compelled to check in with a counselor or support figure. Lack of communication causes emotional instability.
	31.	Posture Training // Must implement, requires special corsets which we've introduced already. Must sit in Dinner Chairs, wear some support-class variety corset including medical. Comfortable Reclining chairs cause Slouching to trigger, effect based around DebilitatingPain Hediff, briefly downs and disables.
Requires a specific posture to avoid discomfort or focus lapses. Slouching or incorrect alignment causes immediate pain.
	32.	Meditative Breathing // Must implement! Frequent Need for Ascetics, who are overvalued in game
