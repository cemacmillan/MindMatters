Need Categories.md
Category A: Sensory-Based Needs

Core Theme: Needs driven by sensory preferences or aversions.

A.I: Duration-Based Sensory Needs
	•	Light Evasion: Requires dim or natural lighting; mood penalty in bright environments.
	•	Hyper-Smell Avoidance: Needs neutral environments to avoid sensory overload from strong smells.
	•	Cold Craving: Needs exposure to cold; heat causes stress.
	•	Warm Grounding: Requires contact with warm surfaces for comfort.
	•	Auditory Filtering: Needs quiet environments; loud noise causes agitation.

A.II: Location-Based Sensory Needs
	•	Ocean Air Craving: Needs proximity to coastal areas; lack of exposure reduces mood.
	•	Barefoot Grounding: Requires walking barefoot on natural terrain.
	•	Horizon Searching: Needs access to open horizons; blocked views cause unease.

Special Considerations:
	•	Dependency on environmental features (e.g., lighting, noise) will require checks tied to map conditions.

Category B: Experiential or Ritual Needs

Core Theme: Needs tied to specific actions, rituals, or experiences.

B.I: Action-Based Rituals
	•	Fresh Fruit Ritual: Needs specific food consumption to maintain mood.
	•	Water Reset: Requires standing under running water to relieve phantom sensations.
	•	Stone Clarity: Needs to handle smooth stones for focus.
	•	Meditative Breathing: Requires specific breathing exercises to reduce stress.

B.II: Interaction-Based Rituals
	•	Night Compass: Requires stopping and reorienting in darkness to relieve spatial disorientation.
	•	Symmetry Demand: Needs surroundings or objects to be symmetrical.
	•	Quiet Teamwork: Requires quiet collaboration with others; solitary work causes stress.

Special Considerations:
	•	Some needs may tie to specific activities already present in the game (e.g., meditation, food preparation).

Category C: Adaptive or Therapy-Based Needs

Core Theme: Needs tied to rehabilitation, adaptation, or structured environments.

C.I: Rehabilitation or Therapy Cycles
	•	Rehabilitation Cycle: Requires time spent on physical therapy to maintain function.
	•	Therapy Check-In: Needs regular sessions with a counselor or support figure.
	•	Posture Training: Requires proper posture to avoid discomfort or stress.

C.II: Environmental Adaptations
	•	Constraint Comfort: Prefers restrictive clothing for security.
	•	Formal Refuge: Requires formal, ritualized settings for grounding.
	•	Minimalist Dressing: Needs simple, unadorned clothing; avoids impractical garments.

Special Considerations:
	•	These needs may overlap with existing systems like resting, recreation, or clothing mechanics.

Category XXX: Violence-Provoking Needs

Core Theme: Needs with a risk of escalating into violent behavior. These will include a toggleable mod setting.

XXX.I: Bloodlust and Aggression
	•	Psychogenic Vampiricism: Compelled to feed on others, leading to potential violence.
	•	Lycanthropy Fulfillment: Feels the urge to hunt or lash out in specific phases.
	•	Combat Craving: Needs physical combat to release pent-up aggression.

XXX.II: Counter-Needs (Conflict Generators)
	•	Crowd Dread: Extreme discomfort in crowded areas, leading to panic or aggression.
	•	Over-Politeness: Avoids conflict to the point of self-harm or explosive outbursts.
	•	Metallic Aversion: Avoids touching metal but lashes out when forced.

Special Considerations:
	•	Marked with risk flags and notifications to ensure players are aware of potential for conflict.

Cross-Linking and Dependencies
	•	Dependencies on AOSM or Meditation Focus:
	•	Therapy Check-In and Night Compass tie into meditation or social engagement systems.
	•	Counter-Needs and Risks:
	•	Any need with violent or disruptive potential should cross-link to appropriate mod settings.
	•	Template Adaptability:
	•	Most needs fit into existing categories (duration, location, action). Special cases like Symmetry Demand may require custom mechanics.

Next Steps
	•	Review and Feedback: Refine groupings based on additional input or missed nuances.
	•	Template Design: Start drafting XML templates for each subgroup, ensuring modularity and extensibility.
	•	Special Case Planning: Address dependencies and violent counter-needs with clear toggles and notifications.
